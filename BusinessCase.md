## Business Case

The current university systems are disconnected and often inefficient when it comes to sharing academic information between students, lecturers, and administrators. Students usually need to visit multiple portals such as LMS, registration, and email systems to check grades, schedules, or announcements. This process is time-consuming, inconsistent, and leads to missed deadlines or confusion. 

To solve this, our project introduces the **AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform (AIDAP)** — a unified conversational interface that integrates all key academic and administrative services into one accessible system. AIDAP leverages artificial intelligence to allow users to interact naturally through text or voice, providing real-time answers, updates, and notifications personalized to each user’s role.

The main objective of AIDAP is to improve communication, streamline access to data, and enhance user experience across all university roles. The platform connects with existing systems like LMS, registration, and calendars to deliver a seamless experience. By combining personalization with automation, AIDAP helps users save time while ensuring information is always accurate and up to date.

### Students
Students can ask questions about classes, assignments, or exams using text or voice. They receive personalized reminders for deadlines, upcoming tests, or schedule changes. AIDAP also gives students a clear view of grades, course information, and deadlines through a personalized **Academic Dashboard**. Notifications appear instantly across devices, and all data stays secure under the university’s authentication system.

### Lecturers
Lecturers use AIDAP to upload or update course materials, send announcements, and monitor class engagement. The system automates reminders for upcoming deadlines, flags anomalies such as missing submissions, and lets lecturers manage TA permissions securely. This reduces manual workload and keeps students consistently informed.

### Administrators
Administrators use AIDAP to manage integrations with the university’s systems, define global policies, and broadcast campus-wide announcements. They can monitor usage analytics, ensure compliance with institutional security policies, and keep all services running smoothly as the platform scales to thousands of users.

### System Maintainers
System maintainers ensure that AIDAP stays operational and efficient. They manage deployments, monitor system health, and oversee AI model updates. The platform supports zero-downtime updates and automatic backups, so maintenance can occur without affecting users.

### Data Source Systems
AIDAP integrates with existing data sources like registration systems, LMS, and calendars through secure APIs. This ensures that every response or update is backed by accurate, synchronized data. Even if one source becomes unavailable, AIDAP uses recovery and retry mechanisms to maintain consistency and reliability.

### Overall Impact
By implementing AIDAP, universities gain a scalable, secure, and user-friendly platform that enhances access to academic information for everyone. It reduces redundancy across systems, increases efficiency, and ensures a faster, more connected learning environment. AIDAP not only benefits students but also simplifies operations for lecturers, administrators, and maintainers, creating a unified academic ecosystem powered by AI.
